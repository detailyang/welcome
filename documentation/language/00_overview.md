### Statically Typed

Leo is a **statically typed language**, which means we must know the type of each variable before executing a circuit.

### Explicit Types Required

There is no `undefined` or `null` value in Leo. When assigning a new variable, **the type of the value must be
explicitly stated**.

<!-- The exception to this rule is when a new variable inherits its type from a previous variable. -->

### Pass by Value

Expressions in Leo are always **passed by value**, which means their values are always copied when they are used as
function inputs or in right sides of assignments.
