## `leo account`

[Back to Top](#commands)

To create a new Aleo account, run:

```bash
leo account new

  Private Key  APrivateKey1zkp...
     View Key  AViewKey1...
      Address  aleo1...
```

:::warning
We urge you to exercise caution when managing your private keys. `leo account` cannot be used to recover lost keys.
:::

To import an existing Aleo account, run:

```bash
leo account import {$PRIVATE_KEY}
```

To create a new account and save it to your `.env` file, run:

```bash
leo account new --write
````

`leo account` has a number of additional subomcommands. To list all options, run:

```
leo account --help

# Output:
Create a new Aleo account, sign and verify messages

Usage: leo account [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  new     Generates a new Aleo account
  import  Derive an Aleo account from a private key
  sign    Sign a message using your Aleo private key
  verify  Verify a message from an Aleo address
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -d                 Print additional information for debugging
  -q                 Suppress CLI output
      --path <PATH>  Optional path to Leo program root folder
      --home <HOME>  Optional path to aleo program registry.
  -h, --help         Print help
```

To learn more about how to use `leo account` to sign and verify messages, check out [**Sign and Verify**](03_signing.md).


## `leo new`

[Back to Top](#commands)

To create a new project, run:
```bash
leo new {$NAME}
```

Valid project names are snake_case: lowercase letters and numbers separated by underscores.
This command will create a new directory with the given project name.

See [Project Layout](../language/01_layout.md) for more details .


## `leo build`

[Back to Top](#commands)

To compile your program into Aleo Instructions and verify that it builds properly, run:
```bash
leo build
```

[//]: # (The results of compiling `main.leo` or `lib.leo` and it's imported dependencies will be printed:)

[//]: # (```bash title="console output:")

[//]: # ( Compiling Starting...)

[//]: # ( Compiling Compiling main program... &#40;"${NAME}/src/main.leo"&#41;)

[//]: # ( Compiling Complete)

[//]: # (      Done Finished in 10 milliseconds)

[//]: # (```)
This will populate the directory `build/` (creating it if it doesn't exist) with an Aleo instructions file `.aleo`.
```bash title="console output:"
     Leo ✅ Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions
```


## `leo deploy`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to deploy a program to the Aleo network. This requires having a funded account. 
:::

To deploy the project in the current working directory.
```bash
leo deploy // Defaults to using key information in `.env`, and deploys to `testnet3` via endoint `http://api.explorer.provable.com/v1`.
leo deploy --endpoint "{$ENDPOINT}" --private-key "{$PRIVATE_KEY}" // To deploy using custom private key, to a custom endpoint (e.g. local devnet `http://0.0.0.0:3030`).
```

See [Deploy](01_deploying.md) for more details.

## `leo run`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to run your program before [**executing**](#leo-execute) it.
:::

To run a Leo transition function with inputs from the command line.
`{$INPUTS}` should be a list of inputs to the program separated by spaces.
```bash
leo run {$TRANSITION} {$INPUTS}
```
This command does not synthesize the program circuit or generate proving and verifying keys.


```bash title="console output:"
 Leo ✅ Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions

⛓  Constraints
 • 'hello.aleo/main' - 33 constraints (called 1 time)

➡️  Output
 • 3u32
 
 Leo ✅ Finished 'hello.aleo/main' (in "/hello/build")
```

## `leo execute`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to execute your program and generate a transaction object.
:::

To execute a Leo transition function with inputs from the command line.
`{$INPUTS}` should be a list of inputs to the program separated by spaces.
```bash
leo execute {$TRANSITION} {$INPUTS}
```
This command synthesizes the program circuit and generates proving and verifying keys.


```bash title="console output:"
 Leo ✅ Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions

⛓  Constraints
 • 'hello.aleo/main' - 33 constraints (called 1 time)

➡️  Output
 • 3u32
 
 {"type":"execute","id":"at1 ... (transaction object truncated for brevity)
 
 Leo ✅ Executed 'hello.aleo/main' (in "/hello/build")
```

See [Execute](./02_executing.md) for more details.


## `leo debug`
[Back to Top](#commands)

To start the interactive debugger, run `leo debug` in a Leo project.

```bash
> leo debug
       Leo ✅ Compiled sources for 'workshop'
This is the Leo Interpreter. Try the command `#help`.

```

See [Debugging](./../testing/02_debugger.md) for more details.


## `leo query`
[Back to Top](#commands)

Use `leo query` to get data from a network supporting the canonical `snarkOS` endpoints.

```bash
Query live data from the Aleo network

Commands:
  block        Query block information
  transaction  Query transaction information
  program      Query program source code and live mapping values

## `leo add`
[Back to Top](#commands)
:::tip
Use this command to add a dependency to your program. This is a precursor to being able to import a program inside the leo source code file. 
:::

The command can be used to add an already deployed program as a project dependency.
`{$PROGRAM}` should be the name of the program to add as a dependency.
```bash
leo add {$PROGRAM} // {$NETWORK} defaults to `testnet`.
leo add -n {$NETWORK} {$PROGRAM} // To pull from a custom network. 
```

The command can be used to add a local Leo program as a project dependency.
`{$PATH}` should be the relative path to the project directory.
```bash
leo add -l {$PATH} {$PROGRAM} 
```

See [Dependency Management](./04_dependencies.md) for more details.
