Once deployed, an application lives on the ledger forever. Consequently, it's important to consider every edge case and rigorously test your code. There are number of tools and techniques you can use. 
- [**Unit and Integration Testing**](01_test_framework.md) - Coming soon!

- [**Debugging**](./02_debugger.md) - Tools and tips to trace errors.

- [**Running Devnets**](./03_devnet.md) - Deploy and execute on a local devnet.

- [**Other Tools**](./04_other.md) - Tools and methodologies developer by the open-source Aleo community.
