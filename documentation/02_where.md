While a deep dive through the Leo documentation is a useful exercise, we realize that it may not be very pratical. To help you along your journey, we've provided a "map" to help you find your way.

## Roadmap

- If you're brand new to Leo, go to **Getting Started** and make your way through [**Hello, Leo**](./getting_started/03_hello.md).

- If you're designing a dApp, we recommend checking out **Leo By Example** for a reference.

- If you're interested in advanced concepts, check out [**Guides**](./guides/00_overview.md) and [**Recipes**](./recipes/00_overview.md). Also be sure to check out the [**Core Aleo Concepts**](https://developer.aleo.org/references/faqs).

- If you're deploying or running your programs, [**CLI**](./cli/00_overview.md) will be helpful.
