---

Leo is an open-source, statically-typed, imperative programming language designed for building private applications on the Aleo blockchain. 
It abstracts the complexities of zero-knowledge cryptography, enabling developers to create secure, privacy-preserving applications while abstracting technical complexities.

### Key Features 
- **Intuitive Syntax.** Influenced by languages like JavaScript and Rust, Leo offers a familiar and readable syntax, making it accessible to a wide range of developers.
- **Seamless Aleo Integration.** Specifically designed for the Aleo blockchain, Leo ensures smooth deployment and management of applications within Aleo's zero-knowledge ecosystem.
- **Robust Tooling.** Leo provides a comprehensive suite of tools, including a command-line interface and integrated development environment (IDE) plugins for Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text 3, and IntelliJ, enhancing the developer experience.
- **Formal Verification.** With a formally defined language structure, Leo enables developers to perform formal verification of their programs, ensuring correctness and security in application logic.
